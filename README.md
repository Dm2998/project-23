#Bike Rental System
<h2>

Our project aims to provide a bicycle rental service that caters to individual clients for a specified period of time, offering affordable and convenient transportation options for tourists, commuters, and recreational cyclists. This may involve setting up rental stations at various locations throughout the city, offering a diverse selection of bicycles, and providing a user-friendly online reservation system for reserving bikes in advance. In addition, our project may also feature an on-demand bike rental option available through a mobile app for added convenience and flexibility.

Our bicycle rental project aims to provide a more accessible and sustainable transportation option for the city, utilizing high-tech sensors and GPS tracking to enhance the user experience. This report will analyze various aspects of the project, including the online reservation platform, rental locations, bike availability and pricing, and types of bicycles available. By providing a convenient and reliable transportation option, we aim to encourage more people to choose biking as a viable means of transportation, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier lifestyle.

#Bike Rental Website with Supabase Integration

A responsive, user-friendly bike rental website that that allows users to browse, book, subscribe to newsletters and manage bike rentals, featuring an interactive map connected to the Google Maps API for an enhanced browsing experience. All data is managed through Supabase, a scalable and powerful backend-as-a-service.

Our project is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers who are looking to rent bikes. To ensure that our platform is robust and secure, we have integrated with Supabase, a powerful and flexible platform for building modern applications. 

It is a map created with Google's JavaScript API. This version allows us to more easily connect the data from the supabase to the Google map. We can see all the stores within the city and we can rent the bike at any store that is on the map.

At our bike rental shops, customers can take advantage of various tools and features to make the process more efficient and enjoyable.

To update the availability status in real-time, you can use web sockets or polling to periodically check for updates to the bike availability status and update the markers or info windows accordingly. This will give the customers an up-to-date view of the bike availability at each store, and help them make a decision on where to rent a bike.
